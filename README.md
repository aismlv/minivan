`minivan` is an exact nearest neighbor search Python library for those times when "approximate" just won't cut it (or is simply overkill).

## Installation

Install `minivan` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install minivan-tools
```

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use `minivan`:

Create new index:
```python
from minivan import Index
import numpy as np

# Create an index with 128-dimensional embeddings and dot product metric. Cosine similarity is also supported
index = Index(dim=128, metric="dot_product")

# Add embeddings to the index
embedding1 = np.random.rand(128)
embedding2 = np.random.rand(128)
embedding3 = np.random.rand(128)

index.add_items([1, 2, 3], [embedding1, embedding2, embedding3])

# Delete embeddings from the index
index.delete_items([3])
```

Search for the nearest neighbors:
```python
# Query the index for the nearest neighbor of a given embedding
query_embedding = np.random.rand(128)
result = index.query(query_embedding, k=1)

print(result)  # Returns [(index, similarity)] of the nearest neighbor
```

Save the index for future use:
```python
# Save
index.save(filepath)

# Load from a saved file
new_index = Index.from_file(filepath)
```

## Comparison with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search
Based on a [quick benchmark](https://github.com/aismlv/minivan/blob/main/experiments/benchmark/README.md), you might not require an ANN and go with a simpler approach if any of the below apply:

- Your document set isn't in the multiple millions and you don't have ultra-low latency requirements (to accommodate a heavy reranker, for example)
- You're in the experimentation phase and want to iterate quickly on the index
- Your application requires the best accuracy
- You don't want to fine-tune any hyperparameters (which can affect [latency/recall trade-off](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) quite a lot)
